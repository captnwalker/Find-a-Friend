# Friend Finder :couple:

## Purpose of this project

>"FriendFinder" is a compatibility-based application -- basically a dating app; but in this case I have given the project a "Walking Dead" theme and designed whimsical questions for finding a compatible friend in the TV world of a zombie apocolypse. This full-stack app will take in results from users' surveys, then compares their answers with those imagined from the cast of the hit AMC TV series, as well as with previous users. The app will then display a modal with the name and picture (of the cast member) who is the best overall match.
